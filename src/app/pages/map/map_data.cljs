There are many exciting features in these maps that are sorely missing in other contemporary maps. NATO mappers intentionally obfuscated sensitive areas like airports and navy yards from their maps but the Soviets include these on theirs. To produce these details, the Soviets had to rely on ground intelligence to obtain both aerial and ground measurements. Discovered in second-hand thrift stores following the collapse of the Soviet Union."

In the end, we had to adjust it by hand using ground control points. Special shoutout to Tristan Bobin for his contributions in rectifying this map."

There are many exciting features in these maps that are sorely missing in other contemporary maps. NATO mappers intentionally obfuscated sensitive areas like airports and navy yards from their maps but the Soviets include these on theirs. To produce these details, the Soviets had to rely on ground intelligence to obtain both aerial and ground measurements. Discovered in second-hand thrift stores following the collapse of the Soviet Union."

In the end, we had to adjust it by hand using ground control points. Special shoutout to Tristan Bobin for his contributions in rectifying this map."
